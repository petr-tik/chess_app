# A flask web-app to organise chess tournaments 


## Run locally

```bash
./run.sh
```

This runs the test suite and then the app locally under address below
http://127.0.0.1:5000/


## Description

Mockup [here](https://moqups.com/pe3v4/7xozNp9y). The app has 7 views: starting menu, old tournament loader, new tournament creator, round plan and results page, and final table.

Create a tournament with date and location info, choose a scheduling system, input all players and it will generate the rounds, record the results and output running results as well as the final results table, which you can send to all participants. 

In db schema each tournament is created with an INT round_num parameter, which is incremented at the end of every successfully completed round, which allows you to load the last uncompleted round. Any uncompleted round won't be submitted to the db, so you will have to restart again.
