Making a flask web-app to organise chess tournaments, 


I've made a mockup [here](https://moqups.com/pe3v4/7xozNp9y). It will have 6-7 views, allow to load an old or create new chess tournament. 

When all players have been registered, a back end will schedule games according to input rules (round robin or swiss) and produce a live form with a list of games, where results will be entered. 
Calculate and show the table after every round and create an email to send to all attendees (they submit emails) with final results and per-round results.


- [x] round robin schedule algorithm
- [] swiss schedule algorithm
- [] implementing swiss schedule algorithm
- [] basic final results template 
- [] add send email to final results
- [] custom decorator to check last round and render different page
