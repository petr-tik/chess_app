	"""
initialise the tournament object with an overall list of players' IDs

input:
a list of players

output:
a list (len = number of rounds) of lists of tuples 
with players' names (maybe change to IDs from db) in white, black order

GamePlans with odd number of players have each person sitting out
Created as a tuple with ('_BYE', 'real player')
Template needs to check for '_BYE' in each tuple and 


where each tuple is of the form 
(['people', 'playing'], 'person sitting out')
Thanks to @DRMacIver
